## The FLUFFY CUDDLES

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to vote for their favorite animals. It displays a collection of animal cards, each containing the animal's name, image, vote count, button to increase the vote count and a delete button which deletes animal from our DB once they are adopted. Users can click on an animal's name to view additional details about the animal.

The application utilizes JavaScript and interacts with a RESTful API such as `Fetch`,`POST`,`DELETE`,`PATCH` to retrieve and update data. It makes use of the Fetch API to perform HTTP requests to the backend server. The server stores the animal data and provides endpoints for fetching all animals, updating vote counts, resetting vote counts and deleting from out database.

The frontend code is built with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. It uses `DOM manipulation` to dynamically render the animal cards and handle user interactions such as voting and resetting vote counts. Event listeners are attached to the vote and reset buttons to perform the corresponding actions.

The code also includes a `form submission` functionality. The form captures the name of the animal and an image of it and then creates an object representing that data. This object is then used to update our the server using a POST request and a new animal card is then added to our DB.

Overall, this project provides an interactive and engaging user experience for voting on favorite animals. It demonstrates the use of frontend technologies, API integration, and data manipulation in a web application context.
